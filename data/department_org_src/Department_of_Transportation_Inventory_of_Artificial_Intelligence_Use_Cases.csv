Regulatory Compliance Mapping Tool,Department of Transportation,Federal Aviation Administration,AVS,"The AVS International office is required to identify means of compliance to ICAO Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs).  Both SARPs and means of compliance evidence are text paragraphs scattered across thousands of pages of documents.  AOV identified a need to find each SARP, evaluate the text of many FAA Orders, and suggest evidence of compliance based upon the evaluation of the text.  The base dataset used by RCMT is the documents’ texts deconstructed into paragraphs.  RCMT processes all the documents’ paragraphs run through Natural Language Processing (NLP) (this process has an AI aspect) to extract the meaning (semantics) of the text.    RCMT then employs a recommender system (also using some AI technology) to take the texts augmented by the texts’ meaning to establish candidate matches between the ICAO SARPs and FAA text that provides means of compliance.",Planned (not in production),User Acceptance Testing to begin early spring '22,"ML (Recommender Algorithim) , NLP,",Yes,Agency Generated,No,FAA Orders and ICAO Annexes,No,No,NA,NA,NA,NA,false,NA

Course Deviation Identification for Multiple Airport Route Separation (MARS),Department of Transportation,Federal Aviation Administration,Aviation Safety (AVS),"The Multiple Airport Route Separation (MARS) program is developing a safety case for reduced separation standards between Performance Based Navigation (PBN) routes in terminal airspace. These new standards may enable deconfliction of airports in high-demand metropolitan areas, including the Northeast Corridor (NEC), North Texas, and Southern California. To build necessary collision risk models for the safety case, several models are needed, including one that describes the behavior of aircraft that fail to navigate the procedure correctly. These events are very rare and difficult to identify with standard data sources. Prior work has used Machine Learning to filter incident data to identify similar events on departure procedures.",Planned (not in production),NA,"Python in Jupyter Labs, ML, NLP",Yes,Agency Generated,No,NA,Yes,No,NA,Yes,Yes,"CEDAR MORs/EORs, Pilot Deviation Reports",false,Sensitive communications.
