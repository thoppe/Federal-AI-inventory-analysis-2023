Normalization Services,Immigration and Customs Enforcement,"HSI uses Artificial Intelligence to verify, validate, correct, and normalize addresses, phone numbers, names, and ID numbers to streamline the process of correcting data entry errors, point out purposeful misidentification, connect information about a person across HSI datasets, and cut down the number of resource hours needed for investigations. 

Examples of the normalization services provided include: normalizing less well-defined addresses into usable addresses for analysis- (such as those using mile markers instead of a street number); inferring ID type based on user-provided ID value (such as distinguishing a SSN from a DL number without additional context); categorizing name parts while taking into account additional factors (including generational suffixes and multi-part family names); and validating and normalizing phone numbers to the E164 standard, including their identified county of origin.

These services are provided as part of the Repository for Analytics in a Virtualized Environment (RAVEn).  RAVEn is a DHS HSI Innovation Lab project that facilitates large, complex analytical projects to support ICE’s mission to enforce and investigate violations of U.S. criminal, civil, and administrative laws.

AIS Scoring and Feedback,Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency,"AIS Automated Scoring & Feedback (AS&F) is uses descriptive analytics from organizational-centric intelligence to support confidence and opinion/reputation classification of indicators of compromise (IOCs). Looking at an indicator AS&F determines if the indicator is present in known-good list by cross-referencing organizational-centric intelligence data of known non-malicious/benign indicators and classifies accordingly if true. If not a known-good, determine if there are sightings of the indicator by cross-referencing organizational-centric intelligence and classify accordingly if true. If there are no sightings for the indicator, determine if this indicator has been verified by an analyst within our organizational-centric intelligence and classify accordingly if true. Lastly if the indicator has not been verified by an analyst, AS&F determines whether there are other reports within our organizational-centric intelligence about this indicator and classifies accordingly. AIS participants can triage against the populated opinion and/or confidence values to identify Indicator objects meeting or exceeding designated criteria and filter out the remaining data. AIS participants may also find value in utilizing the confidence score (if present) and the opinion value to understand whether any difference between the publisher and other organizations exists.

I-485 Family Matching,United States Citizenship and Immigration Services,"I-485 Family Matching is designed to create models to match family members to underlying I-485 petitions. The underlying immigrant petition defines if the I-485 is employment-based or family-based. It also has information about the visa classification and priority date which, when compared against the Department of State’s monthly Visa Bulletin, helps predict visa usage. It is difficult to match an I-485 to its underlying immigrant petition, because the only available field on which to match is the A-number. This number is not always present on the immigrant petition, and name/date of birth matching is not as reliable. The goal of I-485 Family Matching is to leverage AI to more confidently create connections between petitioners and their families based on limited data.

Additionally, it will be able to help identify and group I485s filed by family members, as well as gather up the many ancillary forms they may have pending (such as I765, I131). Similar to immigrant petition matching, it can be difficult to match up I485s filed by family members. In these cases the only similar fields are a common address. Efforts have been made in the past to identify family members by address, but it is effective only to a point. The AI model will help make working with this data more reliable, as well as group individual petitioners, their families, and other helpful associated data together for faster and more accurate processing.",Development and Acquisition,"Machine Learning, Clustering, Regression"
